=================

Image Recognition Using TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks

## Requirements
1. TensorFlow
2. SciPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Numpy
5. Python 2.7

## Instructions to Run

1. Download the dataset from [Training](ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/train_32x32.mat) and [Testing](ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/test_32x32.mat). Place them in the same folder as ```main.py```.
2. Run ```main.py``` and pipe the output to ```outfile.txt```
3. Edit ```analysis.py``` by including the appropriate output file name in the list at **line 10**.
4. Run ```analysis.py```
